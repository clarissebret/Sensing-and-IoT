# Sensing-and-IoT

TheWayToSki is a web-based application that tracks the userâ€™s previous ski activity and retrieves the weather data in the places where they skied. The app learns about the kind of skier the user is and suggests the perfect ski day based on their preferences.  

The application was developed with Flask. The file main.py renders HTML templates and uses Jinja2 as object-mapping engine to inject values inside those templates.

This project was developed by Kenza Zouitene and Clarisse Bret. The author of each specific file is stated at the beginning of the sript for all Python scripts, Javascripts and HTML templates. If the file was written by both authors, their internal contribution is stated too.
