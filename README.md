# Sensing-and-IoT

TheWayToSki is a web-based application that tracks the userâ€™s previous ski activity and retrieves the weather data in the places where they skied. The app learns about the kind of skier the user is and suggests the perfect ski day based on their preferences.  

This project is a collaboration between Kenza Zouitene and Clarisse Bret.
